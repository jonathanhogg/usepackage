.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Usepackage
is an environment management program. It is based on the principle of
.I packages
\- collections of executables that share a common set of necessary
environment variables, such as PATH, MANPATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
.PP
For each given
.IR package ,
.B use
sources the appropriate environment information into the current shell.
The environment information is specified in a configuration file, see
.IR usepackage(1) .
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-v
Output verbose information to the standard error stream.
.TP
.I \-s
Silence warnings for un-matched packages. This is useful in a shell
.I rc
script when a package is known not to be available on all architectures that 
the shell is used on.
.TP
.I \-f file
Specify an alternate initial configuration file.
.TP
.I \-l
List available packages and groups.

Other than the reading and re-definition of environment variables for package 
setup,
.B use
also uses the following environment variables for user configuration:
.TP 15
.SB PACKAGES_PATH
Colon-separated path list giving the directories to search for configuration
files. Shell-style tilde (~) user-directory escapes are expanded.
.TP
.SB HOME
If present in the environment, this is used to provide the expansion for
the tilde (~) user-directory.
.TP
.SB SHELL
If present in the environment, the last path component of this is used for
shell matching (see
.IR SYNTAX )
and detecting the style of environment output that should be used, see
.IR usepackage(1) .
