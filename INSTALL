Short Instructions
==================

	% ./configure
	% make install


Longer Instructions
===================

That's about it actually. You might want to modify where usepackage gets
installed with:

	% ./configure --prefix=/opt/usepackage

or something similar. There are no non-standard configure options to worry
about. The installation is very straightforward.


Post-install Configuration
==========================

Take a look at the supplied 'packages.conf' file, which should have been
installed in $prefix/etc (or wherever you may have changed sysconfdir to).
This has basic instructions in the comments at the top and a couple of
examples. Fuller instructions can be found in the 'use' manual page, which
should also have been installed somewhere sensible.
