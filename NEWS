Changes between usepackage version 1.11 and 1.13

* Just updating the email addresses and copyrights on everything for the
  20TH ANNIVERSARY!!!

Changes between usepackage version 1.11 and 1.12

* More code updating, this time to fix an inclusion bug related to very
  old-school usage of flex.

Changes between usepackage version 1.10 and 1.11

* The code was updated a fair bit to match more modern autoconf/automake
  and C99 standards (it's really starting to show its age).

Changes between usepackage version 1.8 and 1.10

* Now supports shell-independent aliases using 'alias foo = bar' syntax.
* Now supports adding path segments at the end using the new "=+"
  syntax (courtesy of Chandler Wilkerson).
* Skipping 1.9 version number as I never did a real release of it and
  I added the alias stuff afterwards anyway.

Changes between usepackage version 1.7 and 1.8

* Now supports basic checking for existence of directories before adding
  them to a path (or setting a variable) using the new "?=" and "?+="
  operators.
* The order that variables are sourced into the environment has been
  changed to better support using other variables as parts of updates
  to the environment (e.g., "FOO=/opt/foo, PATH+=$FOO/bin;").

Changes between usepackage version 1.6.3 and 1.7

* Now supports arbitrary inclusions into the shell evaluation text,
  allowing commands to be executed, and shell aliases and functions
  to be defined.
* Match patterns (other than the initial package name) are now optional,
  such that a missing pattern defaults to a "*" wildcard.
* An additional optional pattern has been added to match the user's
  shell. This is determined from $SHELL or the shell defined in the
  password database for the running user.

Changes between usepackage version 1.6.2 and 1.6.3

* Fixed ~ expansion to use $HOME if available.

Changes between usepackage version 1.6.1 and 1.6.2

* Split manual page into two (for frontend and backend).
* Cosmetic changes.

Changes between usepackage version 1.6 and 1.6.1

* Now uses autoconf/automake for the build system.
* Small changes to the output messages.
* Fixed up the contact information.
* A bit more portable hopefully.

Initial public release 1.6

* Usepackage has been in use for some time, and had even been available
  for download, but no attempt was made previously to publicise it. This
  release represents the first posted to freshmeat.net.
