Changes between usepackage version 1.8 and 1.9

* ...

Changes between usepackage version 1.7 and 1.8

* Now supports basic checking for existence of directories before adding
  them to a path (or setting a variable) using the new "?=" and "?+="
  operators.
* The order that variables are sourced into the environment has been
  changed to better support using other variables as parts of updates
  to the environment (e.g., "FOO=/opt/foo, PATH+=$FOO/bin;").

Changes between usepackage version 1.6.3 and 1.7

* Now supports arbitrary inclusions into the shell evaluation text,
  allowing commands to be executed, and shell aliases and functions
  to be defined.
* Match patterns (other than the initial package name) are now optional,
  such that a missing pattern defaults to a "*" wildcard.
* An additional optional pattern has been added to match the user's
  shell. This is determined from $SHELL or the shell defined in the
  password database for the running user.

Changes between usepackage version 1.6.2 and 1.6.3

* Fixed ~ expansion to use $HOME if available.

Changes between usepackage version 1.6.1 and 1.6.2

* Split manual page into two (for frontend and backend).
* Cosmetic changes.

Changes between usepackage version 1.6 and 1.6.1

* Now uses autoconf/automake for the build system.
* Small changes to the output messages.
* Fixed up the contact information.
* A bit more portable hopefully.

Initial public release 1.6

* Usepackage has been in use for some time, and had even been available
  for download, but no attempt was made previously to publicise it. This
  release represents the first posted to freshmeat.net.
