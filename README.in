usepackage
==========
by Jonathan AH Hogg (jonathan@dcs.gla.ac.uk)

usepackage is an environment management program. It is based on the principle
of "packages" that are "used". When a package is used, the information
necessary to invoke it is drawn into the environment of the shell.


Using usepackage:
-----------------

Add one of the following lines to your shell rc file.

 * for csh derivatives:

   alias use 'eval `INSTALL_DIR/bin/usepackage -c \!*`'

 * for bourne shell derivatives:

   use () { eval `INSTALL_DIR/bin/usepackage -b $*` }

Then invoke to add packages to your environment by:

   use <package1> [<package2>...]

For example, in the shell rc file:

   use gnu standard X11

Note that usepackage is case-insensitive, so `x11' is also acceptable in the 
above example.

The 'use' command can be called at any time to use another package, for
example:

   > latex foo
   latex: Command not found.
   > use tex
   > latex foo
   This is TeX, Version 3.1415 (C version 6.1)
   ...

If the requested package is not available for your platform then an error
message will be given.


Available packages:
-------------------

As of going to press, the available packages are:

	standard	- things everyone should have in their path
	GNU		- ditto ;-)
	X11		- X
	X11-alt		- X for people who like that flaky 3D look
	OpenWin		- Sun OpenWindows (only on SunOS/Solaris)
	TeX		- TeX and LaTeX
	MH		- scary mail handling system
	Alsys		- Alsys Ada'83 compiler (only hawaii, albatross and
			  walrus)

	Magic		- VLSI layout tool (only on sparcs)
	MEBS		- VHDL synthesis tool (only on sparcs)
	VSystem		- VHDL simulator (only on sparcs)
	Alliance	- VHDL simulator and layout tool (only on sparcs)

	FP		- Haskell and friends
	HOL		- HOL22 theorem prover (only on sparcs)
	Lego		- Lego (only on sparcs)

Please bear with me, many of these packages are moving targets. If there is
something you want that is not here then read the next section.


Customising packages:
---------------------

The file 'INSTALL_DIR/lib/packages' contains the information about
each package. This file contains comments explaining its [[format]]. Custom
packages can be added by creating the file '.packages' in your home
directory with the same [[format]] as the main packages file.

If you need to add a package which you feel should be available more widely,
then please email me and i'll include it into the main packages file.
