usepackage
==========
by Jonathan AH Hogg

usepackage is an environment management program. It is based on the principle
of "packages" that are "used". When a package is used, the information
necessary to use it is drawn into the environment of the shell.


Using usepackage:
-----------------

Add one of the following lines to your rc file.

 * for csh derivatives:

   alias use 'eval `INSTALL_DIR/bin/usepackage -c \!*`'

 * for bourne shell derivatives:

   use () { eval `INSTALL_DIR/bin/usepackage -b $*` }

Then invoke to add packages to your environment by:

   use <package1> [<package2>...]


Customising packages:
---------------------

The file 'INSTALL_DIR/lib/packages' contains the information about
each package. This file contains comments explaining its ``format''. Custom
packages can be added by creating the file '.packages' in your home
directory with the same ``format'' as the main packages file.
