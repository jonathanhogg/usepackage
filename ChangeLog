	* README, usepackage.c: Fixed dumb "Copyright Copyright" cosmetic 
	bug.

	* usepackage.conf: tidied this up a little.

	* Updated copyright and license stuff to latest versions from FSF.

	* use.1.in, usepackage.1.in: split the manual page into two, one
	for the front-end (use) and one for the backend (usepackage).

2002-05-29  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* Tagged version 1.6.1 for release.

	* Makefile.am: removed pattern matching dependency line for .in
	files and replaced it with explicit rules. The pattern matching
	line doesn't work with BSD make and it's been so long since I used
	anything but GNU make I can't remember how to do the equivalent.

2002-05-27  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* README: Updated to be less Glasgow-centric and match the new
	build style.

	* INSTALL: Short basic installation instructions.

	* Makefile.am: Added custom install procedure for usepackage.conf
	file.

	* Updated copyright and author notices on everything.

2002-05-26  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: Now using autoconf/automake to
	generate all of the build system.

	* usepackage.c: Small changes to the messages.

	* scanner.l, grammar.y: Patch from Luca Filipozzi to improve
	portability.
