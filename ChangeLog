2003-11-16  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* grammar.y, scanner.l: Addition of new operators QEQUALS (?=)
	and QPLUSEQUALS (?+=) to variable settings rules.

	* usepackage.c, package.h: Changes to support testing for the
	existence of paths before adding them to the environment, via
	new ?= and ?+= operators. New test_paths function added for this.

	* use.1.in, usepackage.1.in: Documentation of new syntax and
	fixes to old mistakes.

2003-04-18  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* Tagged version 1.7 for release.

	* usepackage.c, configure.ac: Addition of mailing list address to
	online help text.

	* README, usepackage.1.in, use.1.in: Slight fixes to the 
	documentation.

2003-03-12  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* usepackage.c: Changes to support shell matching and inclusion of
	script components into the output.

	* match.c: Changes to support shell matching.
	
	* utils.c, utils.h: Addition of get_user_shell function, removal of
	old is_csh_user function.

	* grammar.y, scanner.l: Updated to support new syntax for scripts and
	shell matches. Also made all matches (except package match) optional -
	leaving out a match is the equivalent of a "*" wildcard.

	* linked_list.c: Updated to be ANSI C (finally).

2002-12-11  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* Tagged version 1.6.3 for release.

	* utils.c: Updated to use HOME environment variable for ~ expansion
	if available. Previously I looked up the home directory from the UID
	of the process, which defeats usepackage when run by a user with
	root privileges.

2002-06-17  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* Tagged version 1.6.2 for release.

	* use.1.in, usepackage.1.in: split the manual page into two, one
	for the front-end (use) and one for the backend (usepackage).

	* Updated copyright and license stuff to latest versions from FSF.

	* usepackage.conf: tidied this up a little.

	* README, usepackage.c: Fixed dumb "Copyright Copyright" cosmetic 
	bug.

2002-05-29  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* Tagged version 1.6.1 for release.

	* Makefile.am: removed pattern matching dependency line for .in
	files and replaced it with explicit rules. The pattern matching
	line doesn't work with BSD make and it's been so long since I used
	anything but GNU make I can't remember how to do the equivalent.

2002-05-27  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* README: Updated to be less Glasgow-centric and match the new
	build style.

	* INSTALL: Short basic installation instructions.

	* Makefile.am: Added custom install procedure for usepackage.conf
	file.

	* Updated copyright and author notices on everything.

2002-05-26  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: Now using autoconf/automake to
	generate all of the build system.

	* usepackage.c: Small changes to the messages.

	* scanner.l, grammar.y: Patch from Luca Filipozzi to improve
	portability.
