	* Tagged version 1.9 for release.

	* Updated copyright notices to 2006.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: Added targets for making HTML
	documentation using rman.

	times in a set of packages to be pushed into the environment.
	Based on a patch contributed by Brett Viren <bvi(at)bnl.gov>.

	* linked_list.c linked_list.h: Changes to return the new node from
	add_to_head and add_to_tail.

2003-11-16  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	* grammar.y, scanner.l: Addition of new operators QEQUALS (?=)
	and QPLUSEQUALS (?+=) to variable settings rules.

	* usepackage.c, package.h: Changes to support testing for the
	existence of paths before adding them to the environment, via
	new ?= and ?+= operators. New test_paths function added for this.

	* use.1.in, usepackage.1.in: Documentation of new syntax and
	fixes to old mistakes.

2003-04-18  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	files and replaced it with explicit rules. The pattern matching
	line doesn't work with BSD make and it's been so long since I used
	anything but GNU make I can't remember how to do the equivalent.

2002-05-27  Jonathan Hogg  <jonathan@onegoodidea.com>

	build style.

	file.
